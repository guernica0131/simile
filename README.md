# Simile

This project is an api for open educational content. Server side it is powered by [Sails](http://sailsjs.org) application. The client side example is powered by Ember.js [Ember](http://emberjs.com/). However, as the api is further defined, any client will be able to connect to Simile to create/generate/and access course content. Documentation will be release as the API progresses.
